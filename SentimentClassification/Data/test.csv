@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS.
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
@AmericanAir I just DMed you
"@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet."
"@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat...."
@united YOU SUCK!
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
üò©üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/yco9dikpt9‚Äù
"@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board"
"@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service"
"@SouthwestAir allows you to change a flight once for no fee, yay! I will always book flights with them. @AmericanAir changes you $200"
"@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!"
@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.
@JetBlue You definitely will!
‚Äú@VirginAmerica: @KarinSLee Of course. Have fun celebrating!‚Äù Thanks! Happy Chinese New Year!
@JetBlue C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled all flights Fort Lauderdale to Philly. USAir flights got to Philly with no problem. WTF is wrong with SW @USAirways
"@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!"
@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
@AmericanAir I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn't allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips
"@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft"
"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
@SouthwestAir thanks for getting me home from Denver tonight despite the snow!
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@JetBlue @Leopolds_IC  No but my friend in the picture - Phillip Heller (JFK IFC) did and he said it was delicious!
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
Very quick! TY. @united: @auciello I am sorry to hear this. Can you please follow and DM me the details of what transpired? ^JH
@SouthwestAir Black History Commercial is really sweet. Well done.
"@JetBlue CEO weighs profits, flyers - @ChronicleHerald (registration) http://t.co/9vKj9S7jrM"
@USAirways @erickofiejones how long are billing cycles
"@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."
@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
@SouthwestAir live in Atlanta but cant enroll in your Atlanta companion promotion. Error every time. Can you help? Also sent email. Thanks!
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
". @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines"
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
@JetBlue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks!
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
"@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC"
@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
@VirginAmerica you will match my #AmericanAirlines status? Cool!
@united okay. Thanks.
"@USAirways why did you Cancelled Flight flight 1773 to phl, while delta flew a flight at the same time, on time? you Cancelled Flighted for no reason"
@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
@SouthwestAir is there any chance I could get tickets to the #DestinationDragons show in Vegas? Ive been a huge fan for years! Pretty please
"@AmericanAir redirect my flight without telling me, service is abysmal."
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@SouthwestAir my rating for Southwest -9 on s scale of 1 to 10
@SouthwestAir last week I flew from DAL to LAX. You got us in almost an hour early. Thank You.
"@SouthwestAir flight 3970, bna-rdu had the most excellent crew today"
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@USAirways flight 1898 landed over 2 hours ago and they still haven't gotten to the gate.. What's the hold uppp üò≠üò≠ #imtired #wannagohome
@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow üò≠
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
"@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight."
@virginamerica awesome deals DAL-AUS for only $39 each way! https://t.co/xCVQXYkg49
@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
@JetBlue üò≠ I used points can I get them back if I decide not to go?
"@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch ""Buy"""
@JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.
"@SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from ""uneventful"" with heavy (panic) breaking to"
"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever."
"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
"@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï"
@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
"@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to""arrange pick up""in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!"
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@SouthwestAir safety back in Dallas!
"@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO"
"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
@JetBlue so yesterday a flight I wanted to Chicago was on sale within my points range and today it isn't. Any way you guys can still honor
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@USAirways i did and i'm not stupid. i've done web development for 19 yrs. the issue (now confirmed by your support) is YOUR website.
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@USAirways @AmericanAir  stranded in North Carolina and trying to figure out options but can't get anyone to talk to
"@USAirways your ticket agents at gate 4 in Providence airport rocked tonight, especially Kristy, sorry if that is not the correct spelling."
"@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue"
"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
http://t.co/EIw2sYb8Fu roberts&amp;s=1 @AmericanAir
@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
@JetBlue I can't pay 30 bucks xD
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
@USAirways  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!
"@SouthwestAir no, thanks. I think we have it straight!"
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@USAirways after a crappy flight due to delays and rude staff members I'm happy to report after paying $25 to check my luggage it's ruined
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@USAirways flight #3739 leaving CVG. Gate agent had no computer and counted passengers on paper. I feel safe.
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
"@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah."
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
"@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
@southwestair so I saw the promo for A-List when I was on a plane this Monday. I fly two more times in the qualification period. 1/2
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@JetBlue Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX on or around the date of March 5?
@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It‚Äôs a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
@USAirways thank you!
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
"@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls"
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@AmericanAir anything you can do?
@united met with agent. All taken care of. Thx for reply
"@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight"
@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
"@USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question"
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@SouthwestAir shout out to the flight #4386 crew for taking amazing care of us on our double down flight! #thankyou
"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
@JetBlue thank you so much for your effort
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
@SouthwestAir I've been a fan of imagine dragons since 2012 and they're my fave band and #DestinationDragons is during my bday can I get tix
@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
"@USAirways I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you"
@united same flight number different flight. I'm heading to MPLS
@AmericanAir I want the flight I have on hold. I don't want a new flight.
"@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!"
@USAirways just called reservations.  Cannot change just able to put note on res.  Problem is tsa...
@AmericanAir now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
"@USAirways We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too."
@SouthwestAir breaking my heart at BWI 9 hrs @business
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/y5qE9HcQzT‚Äù why.
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
"@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding"
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
@SouthwestAir has the best customer service!
"@SouthwestAir Katie, Gate C47, Denver International, fantastic customer service helping me and 2 new flyers; thx for amazing staff!"
@USAirways ok. Thank you
"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
@AmericanAir this is all i gotta say to y'all &amp; your staff... for real http://t.co/rKPRxTGvfL
@JetBlue all up to date. Can't update via Google play.
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.
@SouthwestAir can I get some luv with a fallow?
@JetBlue Thx for the quick response .... yep I tried- but it can't find the flight when I Input the Confirmation #
@AmericanAir hook me up with a free trip to Barbados and I will tell you the secret beaches to see
@JetBlue thanks for the help
@united I hope so too
@USAirways you keep suggesting people call 800-428-4322 but we just end up on hold for hours. You seriously don't have a better method?!
@USAirways if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated.
@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
@southwestair #ftw! ‚úàÔ∏è Hope they'll sing us a song on our flight to Phoenix today. (@ Terminal 2 (Humphrey)) https://t.co/mAvIgetbBw
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@USAirways I need help locating my bag. I arrived in Denver last night at midnight from charlotte but my  8am flight to Hayden/steamboat
".@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now."
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@SouthwestAir great example of customer service this morning at MSY headed to ATL. Alison and Bobbi were fantastic! Gate B8. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks."
"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
"@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!"
"Can I put sun in my carry on? RT ‚Äú@united: @ant_kneee Right now 0 would be a heat wave, so enjoy the warmth! Can you bring some home? ^JJ‚Äù"
@JetBlue any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay?
@JetBlue I'm flying your airline just out of #LGA üò∑
@VirginAmerica is saving my sanity right now: http://t.co/ELtBOLjUl9
"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
"@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Boston early for @TuftsEnergyConf ""Breaking Barriers To a Clean Energy Future"""
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@VirginAmerica ...Please come to Minneapolis St. Paul!
@southwestair Amazing view on the approach to LAX tonight. http://t.co/a68d5fULmH
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
@SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh
@SouthwestAir thanks I think we've got it figured out
"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@USAirways why the hell did you overbook a plane when you knew people actually had seat assignments. #inept #uncaring #piss poorplanning
No they didn't -.- ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/58B7swRpmq‚Äù
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?
@JetBlue it's been a while since I've angry tweeted an airline. Apparently you read my mind before I could bitch. Thank you for the credit.
"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@USAirways won't waive $200 fee due to #neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic #waivethefee
@JetBlue so happy you can accommodate peanut/treenut allergies on flight! 1st online cover from air provider
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
@VirginAmerica sounds like fun !
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add‚Äôl fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@JetBlue Offering Special Fares to @GoPureGrenada @discovergrenada http://t.co/MBcEhCSZX3 @CaribbeJan @islandexpert http://t.co/2Zm4jkAlZl
"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
@VirginAmerica you guys are perfect as always! &lt;3 #WeRVirgin
@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@united flight attendant regains karma by giving big sweaty dad cold water. Guy was running &amp; carrying his daughter.  Last one onboard.
"@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet."
@JetBlue thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA
@united sent
@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
@USAirways it's unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!!
"@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails."
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
@JetBlue nope. Currently sitting at my gate.
@USAirways I have been calling for 3 days!
@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
@JetBlue thanks so much!
@SouthwestAir when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th???
"@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
@SouthwestAir so happy that you can finally put your #southwestairlines boarding pass into passbook! Makes life so much easier ‚úàÔ∏è
"@AlbertBreer just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir."
"@JetBlue No, it's weird!! I picked other cities just to test, those worked...not the one I want. Works on phone though, so I'll use that."
"@USAirways Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a msg that says ""call volume is high."" #vrm"
"@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí"
@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
"@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal"
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
@AmericanAir first ride on new 737-800 with new interior and in seat video. Nice improvement! #Newplanesmell http://t.co/dJJjN9sLHT
@SouthwestAir #stepup #makeitright re you best? Or just money hungry? #wewillsee
@SouthwestAir Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you!
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
"@AmericanAir but don't you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain."
@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
@USAirways @jtrexsocial exactly! How? I've been disconnected 3 times!!!!
"@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV"
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."
@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest"
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 moreüë∫

@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@JetBlue which type plane is flt 1065 from bos to rsw?
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
"@USAirways and at this point I don't need sorry, I need a revers agt to pick up the call so maybe we can make the 11:30 flight today"
@SouthwestAir @geekstiel Do you know when the last chance is?
@JetBlue everyone is overreacting. Keep up your swag!
@JetBlue I will try that. Thanks! If all else fails I will just do the old fashioned method tomorrow morning.
@SouthwestAir sent!
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
"@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse."
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@JetBlue thanks!
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
"@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: ""Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online."" #FUSTURATED"
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
"@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights"
@JetBlue ‚Äôs Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@JetBlue - I will for sure. But my TSA-Pre works with other airlines. Why is Jetblue different?
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United

@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212

@JetBlue wow you guys answer people wow you care I love jet blue
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
"@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because..."
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ

@SouthwestAir amazing service by your SW stewardesses! From den to Cun and from CUN to Atl and atl to lax. Thank u!
@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
"@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.

@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(

@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
@SouthwestAir Thank you ^AH. Still wish someone picked up the phone - 3hrs- dead phone. Taking your tweet as a refund confirmation.

"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."

@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
@AmericanAir Why is your cover photo of TWA? Just wondering.
@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
@VirginAmerica Very nicely done. üëè
"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
"@VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled?"
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@SouthwestAir I love my Companion Pass (qualified 4th year).  #HollyMais

@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
@USAirways is really good at deferring responsibility.
"@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours"
@SouthwestAir thanks so much just had to make a Cancelled Flightlation! I've sent u the info.

@SouthwestAir weather bc of system outage. Hopefully everything goes smoothly now. Thank you for follow up
@USAirways agent won't hold for connection arriving Late Flight. 7 min before departure time but 3 min too Late Flight. Flt 1903 gate c19. Disappointed
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@USAirways You are 0 for 3 so far in on-time flights on this vacation.

"@USAirways flight 2022 out of Phil, no update and was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago.  Sitting in airport, wondering#irritated"
@USAirways ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue

@SouthwestAir thanks for losing my luggage

"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."

@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me
"@SouthwestAir @JasonWhitely flt 947 Emer stop in Albuquer for a heart condition, crew was awesome, pilot was Maverick on the divert."
@JetBlue do you know when the schedule for dec 2015 will be released?
"@JetBlue yes, but it hurt my feelings to walk by MINT. A fella can dream. #happy4them"
"@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit."
@USAirways can't get back lost time

"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
@SouthwestAir  I USED to always fly Southwest.
"@SouthwestAir I notice that there are separate buttons for ""guitar"" and actual ""music"" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this."
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
"@JetBlue Hey friends! Stupid question - Can I split payment methods for a flight purchase? Example: 1/2 debit card, 1/2 BillMeLate Flightr? Thanks!"
@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
@united refund?
@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
@USAirways thank you!!!
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy
"@SouthwestAir that's gotta be a new record: 4 hrs in the air, 11 hrs waiting and 0 bags delivered to destination."

@AmericanAir fcuk you. Shit service. You got no fans.
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
"@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change"
"@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?"
@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
HA! ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/zQuTUS7epW‚Äù
@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.üò≠

@SouthwestAir Fantastic! Thank you!
"@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice."
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
"@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on"
"@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM"
@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
@VirginAmerica Thanks for a great flight from LA to Boston! Pilots did a great job landing in the snow. Can we go back to LA now? #seriously
"@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?"
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait."
"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
"@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!"
@JetBlue What a great idea! #cometoAustin
@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
"@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for ""weather"" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?"
@VirginAmerica You should still develop an app - then you will be my favorite airline.
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
@JetBlue no. Did not catch his name. I am sure Jason will know.
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
"@VirginAmerica Nice, Lofty View @flyLAXairport. #SilverStatus http://t.co/F4Tp0dAwbd"
@JetBlue you guys need live chat.
@AmericanAir I saw it finally come through on the mobile app. However it's for tomorrow and I have meetings tonight that I'm trying to make.
"@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me"
@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@USAirways  big thank you to your ticketing agent Ute V at Dulles-Washington for OUTSTANDING guest service to get me rebooked
@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"
@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
@usairways I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!!
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
".@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it."
@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us
@JetBlue #flyfi thank you! Seattle and #UDUB here we come! @cameron__roe http://t.co/kbHYM5GkAP
"@VirginAmerica awaiting my return phone call, just would prefer to use your online self-service option :("
@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass
@USAirways glad people can put their coats in the storage area though. It would be super unfortunate to leave those on the floor
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 20 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation. Can you assist?
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@JetBlue @airbusintheus A320 landing @aruba_airport in February of 2014. #avgeek #warmweather https://t.co/Kaej9G0CHd
@SouthwestAir y'all the real MVP with these prices...
@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
@united I'll make sure he's done that. Thanks for the help. This is a huge race for him and just trying to make sure it goes smoothly. Peace
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
"@USAirways after 2 hrs of trying to reach real human, finally did and been on hold for 1:36 hrs for out of synch reservation."
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv"
@USAirways on the phone over an hour waiting for customer service  got wrong fight information cost us 6 hours from trip. Frustrating!!!
"@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?"
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@VirginAmerica a brilliant brisk am in Boston in cue for vx363 http://t.co/rMZNIVGmg6
"@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag"
@united I got it now. Wouldn't let me log on with my email. Thx. Here's hoping for dtw-ase without issue today
@USAirways more than an hour holding to change a flight on the phone now.. What's up with that???
"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
@USAirways I have contacted them but only got an automated response that won't give me the code.
"@USAirways through, can you confirm that I haven't been charged?"
"@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves."
"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@USAirways Look into better service.
"@SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice"
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
@AmericanAir thanks! I hope we get movies. Tv's were broke on the flight over
"@JetBlue It's absolute madness in the west, but tell me who you like between @memgrizz @warriors @spurs and @okcthunder"
.@USAirways we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait?
@AmericanAir yes called your UK number on skype‚Ä¶well worth the $.50.  i recommend others do the same.
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
"@SouthwestAir three cheers to your Denver staff. Don't know if we 
will get out but they're keeping us smiling. http://t.co/RX8z53M7yy"
@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
"@AmericanAir @USAirways ""but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated"" {sigh}"
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@AmericanAir Love the new planes for the JFK-LAX run.  Maybe one day I will be on one where the amenities all function.  #NoCharge #Ever
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
"@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help."
@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs
@USAirways Can I book award travel on Etihad with Dividend Miles?
@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
.@VirginAmerica I heard he has a virgin mobile hotspot ;)
@USAirways you should update your passbook passes with any gate changes.
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@JetBlue Awesome thanks! Thanks for the quick response. You guys ROCK! :)
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
@JetBlue Thank you for the JetBlue Credit. Nice save :-)
@united sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT! Tnx!
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
"@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?"
@VirginAmerica wish I can afford to fly with you next Friday  going back home.. love everything  about your airline
@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
@SouthwestAir you guys just rip me off if I could Cancelled Flight every flight I had booked for my employees I  would Buyer beware
@SouthwestAir happy to enter your sweepstakes again #nutsaboutsouthwest
@JetBlue heading to Buffalo... trading the cold in Boston for colder in Buffalo... Maybe the Caribbean next time?
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"
"@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!"
@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
@united I‚Äôve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
@JetBlue can you DM?
@AmericanAir can you guys help me please?
"@USAirways cannot book to redeem companion fair without speaking to agent. $99 vs $1200, this is a family emergency #unacceptable"
@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.
@SouthwestAir no fare giving out clues.  In route now.
@USAirways lol thanks to you we had to switch to American http://t.co/Sl6BDRXfN8
@VirginAmerica this is too cool!  Never been on ur planes but now I will!!
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
@SouthwestAir please reply to my DM ‚ô•Ô∏è
@AmericanAir It's sad how I can't afford any long distance trips though. :/
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@jetblue is there no way to switch to earlier flight to JFK even if I checked a bag?
@AmericanAir hi how are you
@USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround
@USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply.
@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
@JetBlue can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?üò¢
@USAirways Hold time to book award travel from Gold status: 4 HOURS and counting!!!! + 4 days of calling #usairwaysfail @AmericanAir
"@USAirways @AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail"
@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
"@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU"
@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
"@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice"
"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
"@SouthwestAir ha, ha not a make or break for me either way!"
@united DM ed u the request num
@VirginAmerica can we make every VX plane with #nerdbird? Why should Austin be the only one getting nerd love?
@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
"@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight."
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
@JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
"@SouthwestAir aww thanks!! Other than that, love it!"

"@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr"
@SouthwestAir That would be brighter than all the stars combined on the red carpet tonight!
@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor

"@AmericanAir 1491 DEN -&gt; DFW. We don't want to be ticketed on a new flight, just refunded for our Cancelled Flighted flight."
"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
"@SouthwestAir hello I was talking with @SouthwestVerity but it says you moved here, they sent me a voucher but does not work can u help?"
@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@united you hung up on me again.
@SouthwestAir I am committed okay please hook me up for #DestinationDragons
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
"@USAirways yes, i am as well.  **FIVE** HOURS ON HOLD, FOLKS. Can you PLEASE tell me if this is typical?! Trying to be understanding here."
"@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?"
.@JetBlue That's what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it.
"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"

@SouthwestAir when will airfare be available through December of this year? I have 2 major trips coming up and I'm anxious to book them!

@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?

@SouthwestAir Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back.
"@JetBlue do they have to depart from Washington, D.C.??"
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
"@JetBlue I love flying with u, but I have a question, why is one of ur planes called ny jets"
‚Äú@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP‚Äù the service just hasn't been great.
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
@USAirways FINALLY leaving 4 home from NC. Will lodge respectful complaints!! Mechanical issue after cleared for runway? #5hourwait #nocrew
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAMING
@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
"@SouthwestAir Looks like 'On February 19, 2015, we will open our schedule for sale through October 30, 2015' - know what time that will be?"
@USAirways No Problem - he was the only person in the airport who would help :)

@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@VirginAmerica Thanks for your great customer service today &amp; for helping me get all my travel sorted out!
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@JetBlue thanks for your prompt response. I know you put safety first. Unfortunately will hit freezing rain/sleet on ride home.
@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
@SouthwestAir how often are airplane seats/tray tables cleaned and sanitized? rather have air purifier and clean seats than #wifi üò∑üò±
@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@VirginAmerica wish you flew out of Atlanta... Soon?
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
"@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it."
@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
"@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn"
"@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog"
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes

@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
@united Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
@SouthwestAir - holding us hostage for about an hour with no updates if they are taking us to NY or not. What's going @southwestair
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
@USAirways we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't.
"@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number."
"@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response"
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@AmericanAir @TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
You have to follow me back so that I can DM @SouthwestAir
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
"@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again"
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me üò≠
"‚Äú@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT‚Äù A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
"@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline"
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@AmericanAir hey I got a call saying our flight was rescheduled but I can't get through to anyone to see if you're providing a hotel for the
@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8

@AmericanAir Always love opening the upgrade email.
@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@SouthwestAir been on hold now for 1 hour 20 minutes with cust service. Can you help?
"@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself"
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"
@JetBlue don't I always?
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
"@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't."
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
@AmericanAir thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money.
@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash

@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@USAirways #SOS WHERE IS MY BAG ?
"@VirginAmerica Done, but I need the receipt ASAP. Could you please help? #150219-000114"

@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
"@AmericanAir now I have to wait ""more than 60 minutes"""
"@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!"
"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@VirginAmerica Just DM'd. Same issue persisting.
"@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!"

"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers

@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... üòí

@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@SouthwestAir thank you :)
@SouthwestAir is there a link to a site that displays any delays or Cancelled Flightations of flights to and from @DallasLoveField?
@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
"@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child."
"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"
"@AmericanAir great, thanks!"
@SouthwestAir I'm Flight Booking Problems a flight to Vegas. Any good promo codes??
@JetBlue     Is it only $50 for my 2nd bag?  1st bag too full..
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
"@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening"
"@JetBlue big shoutout to the crews on 2017 Bos&gt;jfk &amp; 486 jfk&gt;roc, &amp; gate crews at c19 Bos &amp; 6 jfk. Long day of delays made better by them!"
"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
"@JetBlue if I tell you I like that @warriors pick, will that get me that bump to first class? :)"
@SouthwestAir sent
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
@united 1632 was phenomenal frm gate (SEA) to gate (IAD)
"@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
"@USAirways we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage?"
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir well I'm flying @JetBlue instead - for free! Their credits actually work.
@JetBlue #kudos! And we're done and heading to warmer weather!
"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
"@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal"
@jetblue I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab.
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
"@USAirways status shows ""delayed"" it was just ""waiting for takeoff"" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD"
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it
"@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise"
@jetblue that's cause we're TrueBlue! It's ur #love that keeps liftin' me #higherandhigher https://t.co/xGfS6tJTMo http://t.co/ixM3t5mIZc
"@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking."
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
"@united we got it, thanks."
@united I filled out the form but I haven‚Äôt received any sort of email confirmation that it‚Äôs been received. Is that normal?
@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@JetBlue I'll pass along the advice. You guys rock!!
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW."
@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ‚úàÔ∏è brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!

@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
@USAirways @AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
@SouthwestAir Hey sourhwest can you send me to Atlanta to see @Imaginedragons ? I will fly southwest forever. U guys are the best airline!
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
"@AmericanAir ""Airport snow removal method #22...""

"@SouthwestAir Flying with you in about 2 weeks, bringing blankets bc it's freezing!üòú"
"@JetBlue @courteroy LOLZ. ""On Fleek"""

"@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?"
"@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!"
@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
@JetBlue @roxydigital HAHA. you didn‚Äôt disappoint. Well done. #JVMChat
"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
"@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything."
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.

"@USAirways 167 minutes?  ""Im not trained in that"". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?"
"@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT."
"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."
@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
@AmericanAir Karen Riedel is a rock star employee and a miracle worker.  I really appreciated her help this morning!
Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"

"@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag..."
@SouthwestAir it's never too Late Flight to do the right thing
@united is the worst
@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?

@JetBlue Thank you for opening the conversation.  I hope you can make it right.
@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will

"@southwestair *any site*?   gmail, facebook, etc."
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
@united I think DM would be better
@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
@JetBlue sounds good!!!üíôüíôüíôüíô
"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service üëé"
"@JetBlue That's right! :) Game, set, match."
@USAirways hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help?
"@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd."
"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
"@SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather."
@USAirways do you have an email??
"@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3"
@SouthwestAir darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure?
"@united @Adam_Karren @zj76 how did you save the $200 on checked snowboard? Trying to check in this morning, website wants $200! (prem.gold)"
@AmericanAir received an email requesting I call about a res. but I keep getting kicked off of your phone system. Help?
@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
@JetBlue Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
"@SouthwestAir stewardess really funny! Now I could get the gent next to me to use some headphones, this would be the perfect flight!"
"@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight"
@JetBlue That's pretty nice. Are flight credits automatically given after the flight? I also wish there were a lounge I could sleep in.
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
@JetBlue When will you release November flights for Flight Booking Problems?
"@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage."
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
"@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!"
@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
@JetBlue ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm
"@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5"
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir how do I see your report team?
"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™
"@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue"
@USAirways this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me.
@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
@JetBlue any good deals for March?! Looking to fly to Orlando!
@united message sent. Thank you!
"@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length."
@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@USAirways have you ever lost luggage with an infant and a 4 year old? Then customer service never answered the phone. I've tried all night.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe
@AmericanAir  my fly is 1579  if do you have some news
@USAirways @AmericanAir stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness
"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
"@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!"
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
@JetBlue I thought the same thing after I sent it
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
"@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!"
"@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event"
"@SouthwestAir I understand. Wonderful ""Miriam"" in customer service who was able to reroute me... Got any rental car discounts?"
@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
@SouthwestAir got mine!  Just in time for the wife and my 15th anniversary!
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."
@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
"@SouthwestAir I think that flight was supposed to go to Houston as well, in case someone could check that?"
"@SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience"
@SouthwestAir @DeltaPoints hey at least you guys are honest with your customers unlike @Delta
@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
"@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!"
@JetBlue flight 462 to Boston delayed due to weather in Tampa?
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@SouthwestAir Flight 1700. (PHX TO LAX) Wheels stop.  Glad to be home!  Thanks to the professionals both up front and in the cabin!!!
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@VirginAmerica did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it
@SouthwestAir if I am enrolled in the ATL companion pass offer and booked 3 flights already before May 17 when can I start using the pass?
"@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte"

"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
@usairways Does anyone know the hold times for USAirways reservations?
".@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag. 

Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly."
"‚Äú@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP‚Äù @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues"
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@SouthwestAir @SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok.
"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
"@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way."
@SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler
@SouthwestAir here's a first..both pilot and first officer in galley during flight...
"@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol"
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don‚Äôt need this much trouble.
"@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt?

Best,

@JetBlue haha no need to apologize üòÅ I'll be Flight Booking Problems sooner than Late Flightr. I love JetBlue
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
@SouthwestAir = easy and pleasant. @united = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated

"@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!"
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning

@SouthwestAir I have the DM from @SouthwestVerity if needed
@VirginAmerica  Flight Booking Problems last second flight for next week from SFO- to SAN any chance you want to gift me a promo code since I love you guys
@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@united that's not even an apology
@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights

@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.
"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"

@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?

"@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin"

@JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account

@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&amp;B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
"@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site."
"@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation."

"@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA"

@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.

"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!"

@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
"@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board"
"@USAirways Frustrating days!No flights home, changed airlines. Thank you PHL USAirway employees &amp; @united for help getting me back to IAH."
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@JetBlue  What are your rules on checked baggage and carry ons from SLC to SJO?
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@SouthwestAir  reservation (FEHQNE)  21FEB15 | DCA-RSW. Want refund not credit for Cancelled Flightled flight please.
@JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago.
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.

@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it
@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
"@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!"
"@JetBlue I ‚ù§Ô∏è Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done?"
@AmericanAir pls help. This is seriously beyond ridiculous.
@SouthwestAir Thx to customer service rep ALEX for his patient help in reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight and getting us where we have to be tmrw!
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
@SouthwestAir there's an hour wait here for reFlight Booking Problems in line at Omaha.
@SouthwestAir thx - fingers crossed they are found.
@SouthwestAir Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
"@USAirways this has been my WORST flying experience with you guys, you need to do better"
@united U blow
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
"@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome."
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
"C'mon, this is worse than JetBae. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. https://t.co/yZXfe7au22"
@JetBlue haha. TY. Do you know what time that lane opens at Logan?
"@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good."
@VirginAmerica thank you
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
"@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane,looks stunning!"
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."

"@SouthwestAir Today is going to be the day, I can feel it!  Thank y'all for your support throughout! We're coming home Nashville! #Octavia"
@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier"
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united one lady helping the 12 of us with luggage
@USAirways final count 3 hours 24 minutes on hold to be told I need to log in to U.S. Airways website and there was nothing else to be done
@SouthwestAir why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today?
"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure"
"@USAirways #ShoutOut 2 Kristie(sp?) from Gate4 @ PVD today. She's a #RockStar, was a tremendous help in a tough situation. #PromoteThatGirl"

@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
"@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."

"@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping"
@united no thanks
.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
"@united Wasn't frustrating! Well, not in any way reLate Flightd to y'all, anyway. Impressed that I made it."
@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!

@SouthwestAir well my mom called earlier and you guys had her on hold for close to an hour
@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.

@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.

@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour

"@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers"
@AmericanAir .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage  #AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don't get put on a flight.
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
"@AmericanAir flight 45 JFK-LAS. First the catering was Late Flight, the. No push back crew. 2hrs delay."
@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
@JetBlue sounds great! Thank you!! :)
@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can‚Äôt be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
"@USAirways I‚Äôve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?"
"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"
@SouthwestAir have sent you a DM with the details. Thanks!
@AmericanAir yikes.
"@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear"
@JetBlue you're welcome üëçüëçüëç http://t.co/67k4N9eQ6E
@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
"@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait"
............. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/X7iLzqdwe2
@JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A.
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
"@VirginAmerica Many Thanks for the Follow.

@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@SouthwestAir almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
@JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of
@JetBlue plan to repair its brand http://t.co/ui9M8YpzH2 via @WSJ
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@united still waiting
"@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!"
"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
"@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple ""no"" would do; I just want to know. :)"
"@SouthwestAir On hold over 2 hrs and got cutoff !Cancelled Flightled my flight, now can't get to booked cruise in Florida! Terrible customer service!"
@USAirways your service in Philly is unacceptable. Look into better service‚úåÔ∏è a 16 yr old shouldnt have a hard time http://t.co/WDAKTmr7Mj
@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
@united you are really trying me today.
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
"@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold trying to reschedule Cancelled Flightled flight. Hold music stopped, but no one's answering. How can I reach a rep?"
@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks üê≥
@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
"@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week."
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
@AmericanAir are pets allowed in first class?
@united thank you!
"@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies."
@USAirways what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight
@AmericanAir no. Prebook flight for wife's 40th bday in NO. I recently have had surgery and can't travel. Won't let another go in my place
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
@SouthwestAir Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn‚Äôt Late Flight.
@SouthwestAir how do I go on the scavenger hunt if I'm in Boston?
"@USAirways what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class, I booked the regular ticket"
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Confirmation number just DMed. Appreciate any help!
"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
"@AmericanAir Hey, what's happening with #AA65 Zurich - JFK? Appears to have squawked 7700 and landed at London Heathrow"
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@SouthwestAir Do y'all know when the new routes from HOU to Aruba &amp; Puerto Vallarta will be available?
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
"@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said ""unspecified error"" and to call SWA"
@United to start daily #B777-200ER flights from #Newark to #Frankfurt @airport_fra replacing #B767-400ER on 2JUL #avgeek
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@SouthwestAir Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
@USAirways claims flight Cancelled Flighted due to weather at destination but Delta has not Cancelled Flighted flight on same route.
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW‚Äù I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
"@VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome"
@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
@SouthwestAir can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow.
@SouthwestAir Do you still offer discounts on seats for children under 2? We would rather put him in a seat than in a lap!
@SouthwestAir Just sent DM with confirmation number and passenger name on SWA 3104 MCO-&gt;CMH
@jetblue How long ago can a trip have taken place for me to still get credit if I didn't apply my TrueBlue # when I booked?
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
"@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again."
@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
@SouthwestAir @AmericanAir y'all are better then @united
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your help Adam and to the awesome gate agents at B12 in LAS for getting us home!
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @saysorrychris Can you follow back for a quick DM? ^SW‚Äùfollowed
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@USAirways Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope.
@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
@USAirways @USAirwaysCenter My lost bag lands in Hartford at 639p tonight. Will it be delivered to Danbury CT tonight?
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@united the worst customer service in Denver.
"@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed"
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@united thanks! Everything a-ok now.
@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure.
@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@AmericanAir help http://t.co/hYrAo7A4Uu
"@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page"
@SouthwestAir finally!
@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
@SouthwestAir Thanks.
@SouthwestAir yall have me sleeping in the airport until 4pm tomorrow! thanks
@USAirways @franchise02 my friend has been on hold for 1.5 hours and still counting!
"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
@USAirways thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again
@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@SouthwestAir iPhone app now has passbook support! Whoot! It's the little things in life... üòú
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
"@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!"
"@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them."
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
"@USAirways with the weather mess in the South, I missed my connection in CLT. Impressed though with the Cust Serv phone reps today."
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
"@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. ""Better seat"" is cabin select not behind the row I selectedüëé #DISAPPOINTED"
@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.
@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@JetBlue Airways Adds New Charter #Flight to Cuba - #Travel Wires (blog) http://t.co/Swb1gR57Cc
@SouthwestAir I will never choose @USAirways over you again! #getmeoffthisbird
"@AmericanAir I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a ""System Error"" which is what I ended up calling about."
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@USAirways tell my professors that when I don't show up to class/write my midterm because I'm stuck with no flights home üò†
"@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?"
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@USAirways Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO
@AmericanAir @pbpinftworth iPhone 6 64GB (not 6 plus)
@SouthwestAir just announced non-stop flights to Dallas from Columbus. Well next time @iGotMonte best you'll have less time airport hopin üòÇüòÇ
"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
@AmericanAir  and I forgot about that lounge!üòÇ
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
